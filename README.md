# CSE514A_Project_SU2020
Here are the codes of our group project of CSE 514A. Group Member: Xinyuan Hu, Luyao Liu 

We do almost all the jobs on Colab. Since we need to test several models, we run our own program seperately, with slightly different working dictionary. We upload two .ipynb files and 2 .jpg files related to the working dictionaries of Xinyuan and Luyao. 

Our work based on the codes written by Meet P Shah.
